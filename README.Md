# Histone ChIP-seq various analyses 

Some old scripts from 2013 - 2014 that were usee for the parsing of histone ChIP-seq data. They were part of several exploratory analyses for projects carried out in the laboratory of T. Sauka-Spengler at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford, in the UK, working on datasets produced in chicken and zebrafish FACS-sorted neural crest cells. 

#### Testing observations from Rada-Iglesias et al. ... 

In the following manuscript, authors investigated cis-regulatory elements in human neural crest cells and identified a pattern of primed enhancers surrounded by H3K27Ac peaks that co-localise with H3K4me1 peaks surrounding p300 and specific transcription factor binding. Here are some scripts useful to identify such patterns in FACs-sorted cells from chicken and zebrafish histone ChIP-seq. 

Wyscocka lab paper that describes this phenomenon:
